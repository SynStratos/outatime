Python Framework to Manage Time Series.

## Overview
The main goal of this framework is to simplify the collection of temporal data and related operations.
It is based on the concepts of **TimeSeries**, as a collection of records associated with a given day, and **Granularity**, to indicate a given time interval (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

The object related to a single day (**TimeSeriesData**) contains two attributes:
* day - the reference date for that record
* data - an object that collects any information for that day

On the time series it is possible to carry out numerous operations of different types, as for example:
* add or remove records
* search records by date
* exclude records outside a determined range
* resampling of data
* union and intersection
* batch splitting and data aggregation
* other

## Installation
```
pip install outatime
```
